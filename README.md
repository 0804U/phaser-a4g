This is a Phaser HTML5 framework plugin which allows to integrate both Google Adx and A4G video pre-roll ads into your HTML5 games.

A4G Demo usage
================

The game from this github repository shows how A4G/ADX video pre-roll ad can be integrated into HTML5 framework Phaser game.

Integration steps:
* First include `a4g-ad-plugin.js` into your codebase.
* Then create the A4gPlugin:

```
game.a4gPlugin = game.plugins.add(A4gPlugin.configure({
        zone: YOUR_ZONE_ID
    }));
```
* Whenever you want to show an ad within your game just call `showAd()` function. 
Typically game developers call this function on the beginning of the game and between the levels. 

In order to integrate this plugin you will need `YOUR_ZONE_ID`, please sign-up as a publisher / website at: http://www.a4g.com/#get-contacted
